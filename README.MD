Get ready for the future! The new doktOS is a fully *open souce* Windows **11** ISO.

  

For those (few) people who used (and loved!) doktOS, it's time to merge it on a fully scalable, trustable, open source release and a newer version (**11**). It means you can build on you own and do your own customizations and tweak dependings on your needs! I will only support the tweaks that I propose here.

The mainline of this release are meant to be:

  

- More ergonomics (for those who are from Windows 10

- Enterprise grade utilization

- Lightweight

- Customizable

- Trustable

- Bloatware free!
